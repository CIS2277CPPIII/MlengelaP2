# The PersonGen Class & Eval Specification: 

# Turn in requirements: 
1.	You already have the Turn-in Requirements for your assignment.  
2.	Copy your folder, LastnamePersonGen, which contains both libraries (one for P1 and one for P2), and  it also contains your PersonGen.h file.
3.	 Put the folder on the Q Drive > Assignments> INelson using files.cnm.edu.  I will have a folder there called P2_PersonGen _Libs.  
4.	As soon as everyone has turned in their lib file, I will move the folder to the Instructor Drive so you can access the files.  
5.	Download the libs of two students after you in the alphabet.  Follow the directions below.
6.	Download the file PersonGenTest15(2).txt to be your UseFile. 
7.	When you have completed evaluating the two sets of PersonGen code libs, upload this completed sheet to Brightspace in the assignment titled P2_PersonGenEvalSpec.

# Grading Requirements: 
The students are turning in their PersonGen class code as a static library LastnamePersonGen.lib 
You need to follow this evaluation spec for a total of four sets of PersonGen code libs. You will evaluate the two students who follow you in the alphabet. Students in the far end of the alphabet will wrap back to the top.   The list of students will be made available to you.

Use the test project that you built for your PersonGenerator in P2.  It should be complete EXCEPT the PersonGen files! Be sure there is no confusion between your dev code and the testing.)

For each of the students you need to run, you’ll move the folder LastnamePersonGen into your project folder at the same level as your source code.

In your test driver, you will need to #include “.\LastnamePersonGen\PersonGen.h” in your Driver.cpp to run it.  Also, you will need to adjust the project Properties for each student to add their libraries and folders.

Fill in the table on the back.

NOTE: I will fill in the YOUR RESULTS row.
When the form is completed, upload it to Brightspace for the P2_PersonGenEvalSpec by midnight on the date due.
